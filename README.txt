jVectorMap Example of issue with SVG map exported from Adobe Illustrator.

Create a new map:
1. Open SVG file in Adobe Illustrator and edit as needed.
2. Save as SVG.
3. Open in text editor to copy code to SVG-DATA-PARSE

SVG-DATA-PARSE:
1. Copy the code from .svg file and paste it into "SVG Code" textarea to generate json format for jVectorMap.
2. You'll need to enter the Map Name in the "Map Name" textbox also. (ex. "usIA_en")
3. Copy the resulting code that's generated below into the map file you've linked to.

Look in js/scripts.js and copy the examples for the usIA_en map if you want to add another one.
